        Exactly 6 months ago, you were like "u didn't know I liked you" and "ur cute" and I was like "wtf this is a prank" and we became gf and bf:)
        </p>
        <p>Like I was shaking so much to the point that I nearly got a seizure cuz that was the first time that a girl really liked me or whatever</p>
<div class="third">
<img class="facetime"src="images/facetimetinh.PNG" alt="">
<p>And yea since then we facetimed a lot and slowly got closer and fell in deeper love with each other</p>
<p>Cuz it's funny that we've never actually seen each other in person and yet we were weird n crazy in love or something</p>
